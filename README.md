行列輸入法 (Array Input Method) is a shape-based Chinese input method invented by Taiwanese computer scientist Liao Ming-de (廖明德), co-founder of Eten Information Systems. This free and open-source input method was designed to input both traditional and simplified Chinese characters, as well as other CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) unified ideographs in Unicode.

### Key features of 行列輸入法 include:
1. Character decomposition: It assigns different "roots" or components to keys on a standard computer keyboard.
2. Unicode support: The latest versions support input for an extensive range of Unicode characters, including CJK Unified Ideographs Extension areas.
3. Efficiency: The method allows for rapid input, with the fastest recorded speed of 215.5 characters per minute achieved by Hong Xiu-quan in a 1997 Chinese input competition.

While 行列輸入法 may have a steeper learning curve compared to phonetic-based methods, it offers precise input and potentially faster typing speeds for users familiar with its rules. This input method remains popular in Chinese communities that use traditional characters, such as Taiwan, where it was invented.

### The Character Decomposition Principles of Array Input Method

The Array Input Method's character decomposition principles are based on breaking down Chinese characters into basic strokes and radicals. Here are the main features of the Array Input Method's decomposition principles:

1. Basic Strokes:
The Array Input Method categorizes Chinese characters into ten basic stroke shapes, each corresponding to an Arabic numeral (0-9). These basic strokes include horizontal, reverse curve, vertical, right angle, forward curve, dot, cover, eight (八), left falling stroke, and square.

2. Radical Encoding:
Each radical is composed of two numbers, representing the first and last strokes of that radical.

3. Encoding Principles:
The Array Input Method follows three main encoding principles:

   a. Take the first three radicals and the last radical:
   Following the writing order, a maximum of four radicals are taken. If the character has fewer than four radicals, all are used.

   b. Take the most complete radicals:
   Without violating the stroke order, priority is given to the most complete radicals with the most strokes to form characters, achieving the least number of keystrokes.

   c. Nine cross-stroke-order radicals:
   Certain radicals' complete structures need to be considered first, even if they are written last in the stroke order.

4. Character Input:
Users input characters by typing the keys corresponding to the character's component parts. For example, the character "暫" can be decomposed into "車14", "斤93", and "日01".

5. Flexibility:
The Array Input Method allows users to flexibly decompose characters based on their structure, enabling it to handle various complex Chinese characters.

6. Phrase Input:
In addition to individual characters, the Array Input Method also defines methods for inputting phrases, allowing users to continue inputting phrases after completing the regular encoding of a word.

This decomposition method enables the Array Input Method to efficiently handle both traditional and simplified Chinese characters, as well as other CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) ideographs in Unicode.
